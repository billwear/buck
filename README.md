# BUCK - Bill's Unix Command Kit
An eclectic collection of command line tools for various and nefarious purposes:

- dclock: DisCourse LOCK - lock a discourse topic.
- dcpull: DisCourse PULL - pull a discourse topic.
- dcpush: DisCourse PUSH - push a discourse topic.
- disced.bak: a backup of previous versions of DISCourse EDitor, now being refactored.
- dovali: DOcument VAlidator and LInter - general purpose doc post-edit preprocessor.
- fetch: Simple bash script to fetch a URL using lynx dump.
- google: Simple bash script to google a topic using lynx dump.
- maas_discourse.py: a big (legacy) Discourse API library.
- makebook: not sure what this does any more, but it looked worth keeping.
- mdlint: an early linter; this might be someone else's code.
- redirect-lint: a tool to lint Discourse redirects, written by @sparkiegeek.
- tab2html: creates HTML from Discourse markdown with embedded [tab] sets.

I might add some dir structure here, not sure.
